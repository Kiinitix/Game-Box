## Games
### Hangman
Hangman is really fun game of 2 or more players based on guessing the word! In this, one person thinks of the word and other has to guess the word in the limited chance. For every incorrect guess of the letter of the word, chances are reduced and finally when left chances are zero, the game terminates.

### Number Guessing Game
Number guessing game is really interesting and a bit of lucky game in which the machine sets a random number which the player has to guess. If the guessed number doesn't match with the main number, whether the number is lower or higher is instructed to the player. In this way, finally the player guesses the number and number of guesses are recorded as the result.
